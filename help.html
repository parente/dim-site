                                <p>One dark and stormy night you find yourself walking home alone on a narrow path through the woods. Suddenly, you hear the sound of something rushing through the air and – WHAM – you are hit on the back of the head, hard. You awaken to find yourself strapped to an operating table. You can’t move! Where are you? Why are you there? How do you get out? These are the questions you must answer as you navigate your way through your <em>Descent into Madness</em>.</p>

                                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                                <p>The majority of Descent Into Madness gameplay centers around exploration of and interaction with your surroundings. The primary game menu has four options to support you in your journey: <em>Move</em>, <em>Examine</em>, <em>Use</em>, and <em>Take</em>.</p>

                                <h4>Move</h4>
                                <p>The <em>Move</em> command lets you navigate between scenes in the game. To move, select the <em>Move</em> option in the exploration menu. Then select the adjoining scene in the <em>Move</em> submenu.</p>

                                <p>If you cannot move for some reason, the narrator will say so. In these cases, you may need to use an item or solve a puzzle before new paths open to you.</p>

                                <h4>Examine</h4>

                                <p>The <em>Examine</em> command lets you study the current scene, the items in the current scene, and the adjoining scenes. To examine something, select the <em>Examine</em> option in the exploration menu. Then select the object to examine in the <em>Examine</em> submenu.</p>

                                <p>Examining the current scene typically repeats description narrated when you first entered the scene. If the scene has changed since you first entered it, examining it again reveals its new state.</p>

                                <p>Examining an item yields a lengthy description about it. In some cases, this description hints at how ayou might use the item. In others, the description fills gaps in your knowledge about your less-than-desirable situation.</p>

                                <p>Examining the <em>Nearby</em> scenes produces a list of scenes accessible from your current location. You can move to these scenes using the <em>Move</em> command.</p>

                                <div class="alert">
                                    <h4>Note</h4>
                                    Examine is the most important action in the game. You should examine nearly everything to gain valuable clues about how to proceed. Always listen to the description of a scene upon entering it. Always examine each item.
                                </div>

                                <h4>Use</h4>
                                <p>The <em>Use</em> command lets you use an item in the scene or use an item in your inventory on an item in the scene. To use an item, select the <em>Use</em> option in the exploration menu. Then select the item to use in the <em>Use</em> submenu. If the item is useable on its own, the narrator explains its effect.</p>

                                <p>If the item is not useable in isolation, the narrator prompts you for a second item on which to use the first item. Select the second item from the <em>Use</em> submenu. If the two items interact, the narrator explains their impact.</p>

                                <p>When you have no items to use or your selected item(s) have no impact, the narrator says so. You may need to use the item in an alternative location or in conjunction with a different item.</p>

                                <h4>Take</h4>
                                <p>The <em>Take</em> command lets you pick-up an item in the current scene and add it to your inventory. To take an item, select the <em>Take</em> option in the exploration menu. Then select the item to take in the <em>Take</em> submenu.</p>

                                <p>The narrator reports if you were able to take the item or not.</p>

                                <p>When first encountering a puzzle, listen to the narrator. He will give you clues about how to solve the puzzle. For some puzzles, you will use the keys to browse and select options from menus, just like when you are exploring. At other times, your key presses will lead to immediate action like walking, jumping, or shooting.</p>
